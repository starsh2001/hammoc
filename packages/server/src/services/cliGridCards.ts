/**
 * CLI grid card parser (Epic 37 — Story 37.9)
 *
 * A pure classifier that turns the *settled screen grid* rows (Story 37.1 `readGrid()`)
 * into an ordered list of assistant **cards** — the body/tool/result/thinking blocks the
 * interactive `claude` TUI paints into the scrollback. This is the SINGLE SOURCE for
 * "what cards are on screen", deliberately split out of the modal-only `cliModalDetect`
 * (a card is a more general concept than a permission/question modal) so that:
 *   - Story 37.9 emits the assistant prose ABOVE an input-waiting modal as a provisional
 *     card (the `●` text card), fixing the "choices appear before the answer body" inversion;
 *   - Story 37.10 reuses the SAME parser to stream thinking (`Thought for Ns`) and tool
 *     (`● Tool(…)` / `⎿ result`) cards live, without re-deriving the boundary rules.
 *
 * Grounded in REAL captured frames (HAMMOC_CLI_PTY_DUMP, claude v2.1.162), each rendered
 * exactly as the grid leaves them:
 *   - `● 💻 James — …`                       → an assistant body (text) card
 *   - `● PowerShell("…")`                     → a tool-use card (● + ToolName + `(`)
 *   - `  ⎿  Process : [1]`                    → a tool result card (indented `⎿`)
 *   - `  Thought for 16s (ctrl+o to expand)`  → a thinking-summary card
 * The trailing `(ctrl+o to expand)` / `(ctrl+r to expand)` collapse marker is stripped so
 * the card text is clean (Story 37.9 AC1 spawns claude expanded so these largely disappear,
 * but the parser stays robust whether or not a card is collapsed).
 *
 * Pure by construction (rows in, cards out — no node-pty / no engine state), so the
 * screen-less unit tests drive it with hand-built grid rows — the pattern Stories
 * 37.2/37.3 (`readSpinnerProgress`) and 37.4 (modal parsers) established.
 *
 * The CALLER bounds the region it passes: a card glyph (`●`/`⎿`/`Thought for`) opens a new
 * card and any following non-glyph row is its continuation, so passing the live footer
 * (input box / spinner / mode row) would fold those into the last card. Callers therefore
 * pass the SCROLLBACK BODY (the rows ABOVE the live footer / above a detected modal), the
 * same "anchor to the region, not the whole screen" discipline `cliGridRegion` encodes.
 *
 * Version-fragile like the rest of the CLI screen readers (a TUI revision could change the
 * glyphs or the collapse wording); the grid removes the *fusion* failure mode, not wording
 * fragility.
