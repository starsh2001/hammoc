## What is Hammoc?

Hammoc is a web IDE optimized for structured AI-driven development methodologies. It currently provides first-class support for the [BMAD-METHOD V4](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) workflow — with plans to support additional methodologies in the future.

Built on top of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Hammoc provides everything you need to run a full BMAD workflow from your browser: agent switching, PRD-to-queue automation, epic/story tracking, and a Kanban board — all in one place. No terminal hopping, no context switching.

Fully responsive and mobile-first. Kick back in your hammock, tap a command on your phone, and let the AI ship it. Inspired by Rich Hickey's *Hammock Driven Development* — the idea that real breakthroughs come when you step back, not when you're grinding at the terminal.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 (v22 LTS recommended)
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated (`claude --version`)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Run directly (no install needed)
npx hammoc

# Or install globally
npm install -g hammoc
hammoc
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. First launch guides you through password setup and CLI verification.

### CLI Options

```
hammoc [options]

Options:
  --port <number>        Port to listen on (default: 3000, env: PORT)
  --host <string>        Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0, env: HOST)
  --trust-proxy          Enable reverse proxy support (env: TRUST_PROXY)
  --cors-origin <url>    Restrict CORS to specific origin (env: CORS_ORIGIN)
  --reset-password       Reset the admin password
  -h, --help             Show this help message
  -v, --version          Show version number
```

### Mobile Access

Fully responsive. Access from your phone or tablet at `http://<your-ip>:3000` on the same network.

### PWA (Progressive Web App)

Hammoc can be installed as a standalone app on your PC or mobile device.

- **PC (localhost):** Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome → click the install icon in the address bar. No extra setup needed.
- **Mobile (local network):** Requires HTTPS. See the [HTTPS Setup](#https-setup-for-mobile-pwa) section below.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**
>
> Hammoc is designed for **local network / VPN use**. While it includes security hardening for external exposure (see [Remote Access](#remote-access) below), it has not undergone a formal security audit. For maximum safety, run behind a **trusted VPN** (e.g., Tailscale, WireGuard).

### Remote Access

If you need to expose Hammoc through a reverse proxy (Cloudflare Tunnel, nginx, etc.):

```bash
npx hammoc --trust-proxy --cors-origin https://hammoc.yourdomain.com
```

This enables:
- **Proxy header support** — Correctly identifies client IPs behind the proxy (CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP) for localhost/local-network access checks
- **Secure cookies** — Session cookies are set with `Secure` flag for HTTPS
- **CORS restriction** — Only the specified origin can make authenticated requests

> Hammoc does not apply request rate limiting itself. Configure traffic shaping at your reverse proxy / WAF (e.g. nginx `limit_req`, Cloudflare WAF) — the layer that owns the real client IP and topology.

**Security features (always active):**
- Helmet.js security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Server management APIs restricted to loopback only (127.0.0.1)
- Terminal access restricted to local network IPs
- Login brute-force protection (5 failed attempts → 30s lockout per IP)
- IP validation with strict format checking and `net.isIP()` verification
- XFF spoofing protection (rightmost IP parsing)
- Debug endpoints disabled in production

### Terminal

- **PTY emulation** — Full terminal emulation powered by xterm.js
- **Multiple tabs** — Run several terminal sessions simultaneously
- **Security** — Restricted to local network by default; configurable via settings

### Queue Runner (Batch Automation)

Automate repetitive prompt sequences.

- **Queue editor** — Write prompt sequences line by line, with a sticky line-number gutter
- **Special commands** — `@new`, `@save`, `@load`, `@pause`, `@model`, `@delay`, `@pauseword`, `@loop`/`@end`, `@label`/`@jumpif` (forward jumps), `@(/@)`, `#` comments
- **Execution control** — Start, pause (deferred), resume, abort, and edit remaining items while paused
- **Templates** — Save and load reusable queue scripts; ships a ready-to-use BMad story workflow template in the source repo
- **Story-based generation** — Auto-generate queue from PRD epics and stories
- **Variable substitution** — Use `{story_num}`, `{epic_num}`, `{story_index}`, `{story_title}`, `{date}` in templates

## BMAD-METHOD V4 Integration

Hammoc is the most convenient way to run a full [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) workflow. Every step — from project inception to QA — is built into the IDE.

- **One-click BMad setup** — Initialize `.bmad-core` in any project with version selection
- **BMad Agent switching** — Instantly switch between agents (SM, PM, Architect, Dev, QA, PO, etc.) in chat with a single tap
- **Slash commands per agent** — Context-aware `/commands` that change based on the active BMad agent
- **PRD → Queue automation** — Auto-generate prompt queues directly from your PRD epics and stories
- **Project overview dashboard** — Visual status showing PRD completion, epic progress, and story status
- **Kanban board integration** — Track epics and stories with status workflow, promote/validate actions
- **Story workflows** — Start development, request QA, and apply fixes — all through the board UI

> **Methodology support roadmap:** Hammoc is designed to be methodology-agnostic. BMAD-METHOD V4 is the first supported workflow, with more development methodologies planned for future releases.

For detailed BMAD-METHOD documentation, visit the [official repository](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD).

## HTTPS Setup (for Mobile PWA)

PWA installation on mobile devices requires HTTPS. Hammoc automatically starts in HTTPS mode when TLS certificates are found at `~/.hammoc/cert.pem` and `~/.hammoc/key.pem`. If no certificates are found, it falls back to HTTP.

### Option 1: mkcert (Recommended)

1. **Install mkcert:**

   ```bash
   # Windows
   winget install FiloSottile.mkcert

   # macOS
   brew install mkcert

   # Linux
   # See https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation
   ```

2. **Create a local CA and generate certificates:**

   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert -key-file ~/.hammoc/key.pem -cert-file ~/.hammoc/cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 YOUR_LOCAL_IP
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_LOCAL_IP` with your PC's IP address (e.g., `192.168.0.10`).

3. **Install the root CA on your mobile device:**

   Find the CA certificate location:
   ```bash
   mkcert -CAROOT
   ```

   Transfer `rootCA.pem` to your mobile device, then:
   - **Android:** Settings → Security → Install certificate
   - **iOS:** Open the file → Install Profile → Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → Enable

4. **Start Hammoc** — it will automatically detect the certificates and start in HTTPS mode:

   ```
   Hammoc Server running on:
     Local:   https://localhost:3000
     Network: https://192.168.0.10:3000
     TLS:     enabled (certs from ~/.hammoc/)
   ```

5. **Open on mobile:** Navigate to `https://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000` and install the PWA.

### Option 2: Reverse Proxy

If you already have a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.) handling HTTPS, simply keep Hammoc running in HTTP mode (no certificates needed) and point your proxy to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `NODE_ENV` | — | Set to `production` for optimized mode |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Enable reverse proxy support (Cloudflare Tunnel, nginx, etc.) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `true` | CORS origin (`true` allows any; set a URL to restrict) |
| `CHAT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | Chat response timeout (ms) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO`/`DEBUG` | ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE |
| `TERMINAL_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable terminal feature |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | — | Telegram bot token for notifications |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | — | Telegram chat ID for notifications |
